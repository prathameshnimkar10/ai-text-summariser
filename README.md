# AI Text Summariser using Postman, HuggingFace model

So as a part of a certification course, I made a text summariser using a HuggingFace model (https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn), Javascript and Postman for testing. To summarise text, any text of 200-100000 words can be pasted in the input box and an appropriate response will be geenrated.</br>

More website beautification is to be done, but the model works. </br>

Use npm i to install node modules to run the project.
